# Chuck Norris and Webex Teams
Post a random Chuck Norris joke into Webex Teams using Python and the Requests library.

roomID - Find the roomId of the room you wish to post the Chuck Norris joke to and update the roomId variable with single 'quotes' in the config.py file.

access_token - Normally when developing something that will interact with Webex Teams you would create a bot and use the bot access token but for this simple exercise you can use a personal access token but keep in mine they expire every 12 hours.  Retrieve your personl access token and update the access_token variable in single 'quotes' in the config.py file.
